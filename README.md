## How it works

This is like programmatically clicking the "Export" button in ArcGIS Online (or ArcGIS Enterprise). You must be logged in, and it will create a new item for the export, and then you can download it. You can do this all in one step within your JavaScript, which this sample demonstrates.

## Quick Start

To run the demo, in a terminal run:

```bash
npx serve
```
